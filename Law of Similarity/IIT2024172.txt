Exlanation :

In the left screen (Bad Similarity), similar elements do not look similar:
The heading, labels, and button use inconsistent colors.
Input fields and the Sign In button look almost the same.
Text, placeholders, and controls do not follow a clear visual pattern.

In the right screen (Good Similarity), similar elements are styled consistently:
All input fields look the same, clearly showing they belong to one group.
Labels and placeholders follow a uniform style.
The Sign In button has a distinct color and shape, making it clearly different from text and inputs.
This creates a clear visual flow and makes relationships between elements immediately obvious.
