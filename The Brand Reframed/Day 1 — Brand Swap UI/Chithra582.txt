Brand Pair Chosen:
Swiggy → Zomato

Key Design Decisions:

       1.Adopted Zomato’s bold red-and-white color palette to establish a confident and premium visual tone.

       2.Used clean layouts, strong typography, and minimal UI elements to match Zomato’s design language.

       3.Maintained generous spacing and clear visual hierarchy for better readability and usability.

       4.Applied consistent button styles, cards, and typography across the Hero, Home, and Login screens.

       5.Preserved Swiggy’s original food-delivery purpose and content structure without altering app flow.
